This mod provides a simple rebalance to the engagement ranges of the line and artillery combat computers. The values of 50 and 80 present in the base game do not make sense in the context of the weapons which can be deployed on each ship type, particularly for ships primarily mounting large weapons. 

The Table below details the changes currently present in this mod:

| Computer  | Effect | Preferred Attack Range (Default) | Formation Distance (Default) | Return to Formation Distance (Default) |
|-----------|--------|---------------------------------:|-----------------------------:|---------------------------------------:|
| Swarm     | Fire Rate / Evasion / Speed | 10 (10) | 10 (10) | 60 (60) |
| Picket    | Fire Rate / Evasion / Accuracy | 30 (30) | 30 (30) | 40 (40) |
| Line      | Fire Rate / Accuracy | 80 (50) | 80 (50) | 90 (60) |
| Artillery | Fire Rate / Range | 120 (80) | 120 (80) | 130 (90) |

The Artillery computer is intended to be used with the advanced large weapons which have ranges between 120 and 150. Line computer is intended to be used with the standard large weapons which range between 60 and 80 base.
